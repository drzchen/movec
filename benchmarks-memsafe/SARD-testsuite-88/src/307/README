RUNNING TEST CASES
run with:     ttflag-bad -d 4294967200-100
result:       tTdvect, a global variable defined in my-main.c, gets underflowed in function tTflag.  No canary to view results.  tTvect is an alias for tTdvect and it is written via index first, i.e. tTvect[first++] = i.  The index first is printed out and so you can verify that it goes negative.
