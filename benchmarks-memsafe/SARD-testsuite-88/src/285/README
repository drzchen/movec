RUNNING TEST CASES
run with:     call-realpath-bad /aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aaa/aa/aaa
result:       curpath, which is allocated at 46 bytes, is overflowed when a strcpy tries to copy 386 bytes into it, in function mt_realpath.  a segfault occurs and the canary placed above curpath on the stack is overflowed.
